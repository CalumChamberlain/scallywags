# RballNL
An application for a local racquetball group

This project is still under construction

## What is RballNL?
I have a local racquetball group that I play with on a regular basis and I noticed that communication, both internal and public, could be improved.
My main goal in developing this website was to provide myself with a fresh new project that I can use to teach myself the Laravel framework using a real world example. 

## Main Features

- direct messaging between users
- a custom reddit-like forum for discussions regarding games, tips, gear recommendations, etc.
- an interactive calendar where users can view court bookings. Users can also view details for games marked as public and join in. Users will have the option to select a free court to book and invite other members.
- notifications: email and database notifications when a user is invited to a game, a game is cancelled, a direct message was recieved, or they need to renew their membership.
- using stripe/paypal, the admin can accept membership payments from users and monitor users.
- a public online presence where potential new members can learn more about us or the sport.
